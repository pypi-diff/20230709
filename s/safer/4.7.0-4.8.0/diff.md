+# ðŸ§¿ `safer`: A safer writer ðŸ§¿
 
+Avoid partial writes or corruption!
+
+`safer` wraps file streams, sockets, or a callable, and offers a drop-in
+replacement for regular old `open()`.
+
+## Quick summary
+
+### A tiny example
+
+    import safer
+
+    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
+        fp.write('one')
+        print('two', file=fp)
+        raise ValueError
+        # filename was not written.
+
+
+### How to use
+
+Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) to install `safer` from the command
+line: `pip install safer`.
+
+Tested on Python 3.4 - 3.11.  An old Python 2.7 version
+is [here](https://github.com/rec/safer/tree/v2.0.5).
+
+See the Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@TomSwirly/%EF%B8%8F-safer-a-safer-file-writer-%EF%B8%8F-5fe267dbe3f5)
+
+### The details
+
+`safer` helps prevent programmer error from corrupting files, socket
+connections, or generalized streams by writing a whole file or nothing.
+
+It does not prevent concurrent modification of files from other threads or
+processes: if you need atomic file writing, see
+https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites/
+
+It also has a useful `dry_run` setting to let you test your code without
+actually overwriting the target file.
+
+* `safer.writer()` wraps an existing writer, socket or stream and writes a
+  whole response or nothing
+
+* `safer.open()` is a drop-in replacement for built-in `open` that
+  writes a whole file or nothing
+
+* `safer.closer()` returns a stream like from `safer.write()` that also
+  closes the underlying stream or callable when it closes.
+
+* `safer.dump()` is like a safer `json.dump()` which can be used for any
+  serialization protocol, including Yaml and Toml, and also allows you to
+  write to file streams or any other callable.
+
+* `safer.printer()` is `safer.open()` except that it yields a
+  a function that prints to the stream.
+
+By default, `safer` buffers the written data in memory in a `io.StringIO`
+or `io.BytesIO`.
+
+For very large files, `safer.open()` has a `temp_file` argument which
+writes the data to a temporary file on disk, which is moved over using
+`os.rename` if the operation completes successfully.  This functionality
+does not work on Windows.  (In fact, it's unclear if any of this works on
+Windows, but that certainly won't.  Windows developer solicted!)
+
+
+### Example: `safer.writer()`
+
+`safer.writer()` wraps an existing stream - a writer, socket, or callback -
+in a temporary stream which is only copied to the target stream at close(), and
+only if no exception was raised.
+
+Suppose `sock = socket.socket(*args)`.
+
+The old, dangerous way goes like this.
+
+    try:
+        write_header(sock)
+        write_body(sock)   # Exception is thrown here
+        write_footer(sock)
+     except Exception:
+        write_error(sock)  # Oops, the header was already written
+
+With `safer` you write all or nothing:
+
+    try:
+        with safer.writer(sock) as s:
+            write_header(s)
+            write_body(s)  # Exception is thrown here
+            write_footer(s)
+     except Exception:
+        write_error(sock)  # Nothing has been written
+
+### Example: `safer.open()` and json
+
+`safer.open()` is a a drop-in replacement for built-in `open()` except that
+when used as a context, it leaves the original file unchanged on failure.
+
+It's easy to write broken JSON if something within it doesn't serialize.
+
+    with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
+        json.dump(data, fp)
+        # If an exception is raised, the file is empty or partly written
+
+`safer` prevents this:
+
+    with safer.open(filename, 'w') as fp:
+        json.dump(data, fp)
+        # If an exception is raised, the file is unchanged.
+
+`safer.open(filename)` returns a file stream `fp` like `open(filename)`
+would, except that `fp` writes to memory stream or a temporary file in the
+same directory.
+
+If `fp` is used as a context manager and an exception is raised, then the
+property `fp.safer_failed` on the stream is automatically set to `True`.
+
+And when `fp.close()` is called, the cached data is stored in `filename` -
+*unless* `fp.safer_failed` is true.
+
+### Example: `safer.printer()`
+
+`safer.printer()` is similar to `safer.open()` except it yields a function
+that prints to the open file - it's very convenient for printing text.
+
+Like `safer.open()`, if an exception is raised within its context manager,
+the original file is left unchanged.
+
+Before.
+
+    with open(file, 'w') as fp:
+        for item in items:
+            print(item, file=fp)
+        # Prints lines until the first exception
+
+With `safer`
+
+    with safer.printer(file) as print:
+        for item in items:
+            print(item)
+        # Either the whole file is written, or nothing
